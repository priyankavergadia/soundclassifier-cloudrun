  <h1>Sound Classifier built with Teachable Machine and hosted on Cloud Run</h1>
  <p>This is a demonstration of sound classification using a model trained with Google's Teachable Machine project. If
    you clap, play guitar or chirp like a bird, this model will classify the sound as those labels. 
    (Until a label is detected the canvas displays "Analysis Emoji")
